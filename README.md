#Clicky Game!

###Objective
To create a memory game as a React app. 

###Instructions
You can play the game [here](https://sashikers.github.io/react-clicky-game/).

###Overview
When loaded, the user sees 12 images.

The goal of the game is to click on each image once. Images reshuffle after each click. Clicking on a new image earns the user a point. The top score stays consistent throughout the game.

If the user clicks an image that has already been selected (or correctly selects all 12 individual queens), the current score resets to 0 and the images get reshuffled. To start a new game, the user can resume clicking.
